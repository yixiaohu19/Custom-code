# Custom-code
Custom code for data analysis and plotting. 
The original code needs to read a 64x65 array data input from a specific serial port on the computer in order to run properly. This is to adapt to our data acquisition chip. Therefore, in order to provide an example of our code running, we also provided a test program that pre-inputs a fixed array and plots it. This program follows the same principle of plotting as our main program, and can be used to verify the feasibility of our code. The original code can also run properly when there is a serial port connection and data input. All the required modules in the code are open-source modules that come with Python and can be installed through pip command.
